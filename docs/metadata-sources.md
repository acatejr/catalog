## FSGeodata

[The USDA Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/) is an online collection of digital data related to forest resources. Through the Clearinghouse you can find datasets related to forests and grasslands, including boundaries and ownership, natural resources, roads and trails, as well as datasets related to State and private forested areas, including insect and disease threat and surface water importance. You can also find downloadable map products, raster data, and links to other sources of forest resource information.

## DataHub

The U.S. Forest Service has configured an open data [site](https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/) to help partners and the public discover geospatial data published by the Agency.

## Research Data Archive (RDA)

The FS [Research Data Archive](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/) offers a catalog of hundreds of research datasets funded by Forest Service Research and Development (FS R&D) or by the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP). Of special interest, the collection includes long-term datasets from a number of Forest Service Experimental Forests, Ranges, and Watersheds (FS EFRs).
