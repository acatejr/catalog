# Catalog

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) has a wealth of geospatial and tabluar data. Accessing this data typically involves navigating the websites, browsing through hundreds of datasets, and manually downloading metadata XML files and MapServer service URLs for each dataset you need. For researchers and developers working with multiple datasets, this manual process can become a bottleneck.  Often questions like:  

- Where is a specific data set stored?
- What data sets are recommended for building a dashboard?
- What is the data lineage of a specific dataset?
- What are the major FS systems and how are they interconneccted?
- How are two systems interconncted?

## The Process

The first thing was identifying metadata sources.  Three sources were identified:

1. [Forest Service Research Data Archive (RDA)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/)
2. [Geospatial Data Discovery (GDD)](https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/)
3. [Forest Service Geospatial Data Clearing House (FSGeodata)](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/)

### Forest Service Research Data Archive (RDA)

The FS Research Data Archive offers a catalog of hundreds of research datasets funded by Forest Service Research and Development (FS R&D) or by the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP).

### Geospatial Data Discovery (GDD)

The U.S. Forest Service has configured this open data site to help our partners and the public discover geospatial data published by the Agency. Use it together with your data to create maps, apps and other information products.

### Forest Service Geospatial Data Clearing House (FSGeodata)

The USDA Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse is an online collection of digital data related to forest resources. Through the Clearinghouse you can find datasets related to forests and grasslands, including boundaries and ownership, natural resources, roads and trails, as well as datasets related to State and private forested areas, including insect and disease threat and surface water importance. You can also find downloadable map products, raster data, and links to other sources of forest resource information.
