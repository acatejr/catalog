# Catalog Documentation

## Introduction

The United States Forest Service (USFS) has vast amounts of spatial and tabular data used in managing the United States' National Forest resources as well as data used to manage the USFS internal operations.  USFS has several enterprise-scale data management systems used to manage and publish data.  The USFS is also mandated to apply metadata standards to its data set in order to comply with US Federal Government Acts that include:

- 2002 E-Government Act
- 2018 Evidence Act
- 2018 The Geospatial Data Act (GDA)

This project is a proof-of-concept project that harvests metadata from different USFS systems in order to build a catalog system that allows users to ask questions like:

- What data fields does are in a spatial fire dataset?
- What is the data lineage of a field in a dataset (sptial and/or tabular)?
- Where can data set be found?
- What data sets might be useful in order to build a data dashboard for tracking and monitoring timber harvests?
